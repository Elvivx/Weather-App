# Weather Web Application
This is a web app that has been built with react + vite, it has  geolocation functionality to automatically get users approximate location and return the appropriate weather data for that location.
This app has also been fitted with the functionality to also search for available locactions (not all locations are available) by clicking on the plus (+) icon at the far top left, which would open up an input field which the user inputs the desired location.
Dark and  Light mood are also available for ease and less strain on the eyes.

# Have Fun....😁😁
